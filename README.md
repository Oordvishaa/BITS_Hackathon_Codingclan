Problem statememt:1. We have created a login page, a sign-in page for new users, a homepage where new and existing questions appear , and a reply page where users can reply to questions or other replies also. We have used MERN Stack
We have selected the first problem statement, i.e. creating an online community education forum. We have used MERN Stack for the same and used the database Mondo DB Atlas.
We first have a login page that ensures only valid users to enter.
If you dont have an account it will redirect you to the sign-in page. 
This step ensure that there is genuine users in the forum.
Then you will be redirected to the homepage where users can enter questions.
The previous questions will be saved and shown at the bottom so that users can reply to them if they know the answers. 
We then have a reply page that allows users to reply to an existing question or reply to another answer posted buy some other user.
